# How to Run the iOS App

Since you don't have Xcode installed on this Mac, you cannot run the "Simulator" on the screen. Instead, you will run it **on your physical iPhone**.

### Step 1: Download App
On your iPhone, open the **App Store** and download the app called **"Expo Go"**.

### Step 2: Connect to Wi-Fi
Make sure your iPhone is connected to the **same Wi-Fi network** as this computer.

### Step 3: Scan Code
1.  Open the **Camera** app on your iPhone.
2.  Point it at the **QR Code** displayed in the terminal window below.
3.  Tap the "Open in Expo Go" notification.

The app will load on your phone!
